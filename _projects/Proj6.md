(Completed) Characterisation of China's environmental technologies in Europe (SIP summer research project by Prof. Zhang Yameng, Head of SIP's International Business programme).

I use data analysis tools such as Excel, Python, SPSS, etc. to analyse and visualise a large amount of data in the fDi Markets Library database, summarise the regularities and causes, and make recommendations for the business.

My professor of this project: Prof. Yameng Zhang.
