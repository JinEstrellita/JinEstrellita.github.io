(In progress) Brain Muscle Electrode Project (Prof. Wang Hui, Prof. Wang Zong, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine) Chip design has been completed, mask plate, PDMS chip surface treatment, etc.

The following chart lists some of the literature collected.

I joined the project and did a lot of literature searching and collecting in preparation for writing the review, learnt about the history of the field of electrodes and the existing applications and types of electrodes, and created a detailed tree diagram of electrode types and functions in conjunction with the lectures I attended.

I am unable to show the electrodes I designed because the patent and project are not yet complete. I drew four-way, 6-way, 8-way, 10-way, 12-way, and 14-way electrodes for our experiment. I have also found an electrode surface treatment that meets our requirements. The progress so far is that the PDMS countermould has been completed.
