Because of the patent and the project is not finished, I could not present the electrode that we designed. I have drawn four-wayï¼Œ6-way,8-way, 10-way, 12-way,14-way electrodes for our experiments. I also tried to find a way to do the surface treatment that fit our requirements. The current progress was finished the PDMS reverse mold.
